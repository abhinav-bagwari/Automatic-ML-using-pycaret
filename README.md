# Automatic-ML-using-pycaret

PyCaret is a deployment ready Python library which means that as you perform an experiment, all steps are automatically saved in a pipeline which can be deployed into production with ease. PyCaret automatically orchestrates all dependencies in a pipeline. Once a pipeline is developed, it can be transferred to another environment to run at scale. All preprocessing and the data preparation tasks are part of a pipeline in PyCaret
